This project is an AI-powered dream interpretation system that uses classical Islamic literature to provide meaningful explanations for users' dreams. By integrating state-of-the-art language models like LLaMA 3 (70B) through Groq's ultra-fast inference API, the system can analyze user-submitted dream descriptions and generate interpretations based on insights extracted from two authentic sources: Ibn Sirin’s and Ibn Raashid’s dream books. The PDFs of these books are processed using natural language techniques, split into searchable chunks, and embedded using Hugging Face’s MiniLM model. These embeddings are then indexed using FAISS, enabling accurate similarity search when the user inputs a new dream.

The system offers a personalized and knowledge-based response for each dream, comparing it against both books and returning interpretations in a clear, concise format. It also stores each dream and its results in a JSON-based dream history log, allowing users to revisit previous queries. This fusion of classical Islamic knowledge with modern AI techniques not only preserves and digitizes traditional wisdom but also makes it accessible and interactive for today’s users, especially those seeking interpretations grounded in faith and scholarship.
